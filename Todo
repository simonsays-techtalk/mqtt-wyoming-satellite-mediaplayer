1. Integrate the Media Player in Home Assistant

    Ensure MQTT discovery works so Home Assistant automatically detects the media player.
    If it's not discovered, we can manually configure it.

âœ… 2. Implement Full TTS Integration

    Send Text-to-Speech (TTS) messages to the satellite.
    Use Wyoming TTS or an external TTS engine (like Piper or Google Cloud TTS).

âœ… 3. Enable Volume Control via MQTT

    Allow Home Assistant to adjust the satellite volume dynamically.
    Use MQTT commands like "volume_set": 0.5 (50%).

âœ… 4. Automate Media Playback

    Example: Play a doorbell sound when the front door opens.
    Example: Announce weather updates in the morning.

âœ… 5. Stream Audio to the Satellite

    Investigate ways to stream live audio from Home Assistant or another device.
    Possible options:
    ðŸ”¹ Use RTP or UDP audio streaming
    ðŸ”¹ MQTT-based streaming
    ðŸ”¹ Pipe audio from a web radio or file playback
